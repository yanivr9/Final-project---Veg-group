      The Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Israel offers a variety of services, including: sheltering
      abandoned animals and finding them adoptive homes, a veterinary clinic, and boarding kennels for pets. AAB(Adopt a
      buddy) is proud of its Humane Education Department that runs educational activities for groups of all ages and all
      sectors. The Society is also active at the Parliamentary level, lobbying for laws that promote animal welfare.

    <p class="mx-auto col-lg-9 text-justify">
      According to AAB policy, its doors are open at all times to all animals in need of shelter and protection. In
      addition, as a result of many years’ experience, the AAB(Adopt a buddy)has created “Responsible Adoption”, the aim
      of which is to reach optimal compatibility between animal and adopter, so that the animal will be raised in its
      new home for its entire life span. All the dogs and cats that are given out for adoption are neutered or spayed.
      These principles, which were determined to reduce uncontrolled propagation, thus minimizing the number of stray
      animals, stem from our commitment to prevent animal suffering.

      In the first AAB shelter, established with the assistance of the British authorities on Hashalom Street, Tel Aviv,
      we mostly cared for horses, donkeys and camels. These “beasts of burden” were abandoned when they grew ill or old.
      In the first decades of the AAB existence, dogs and cats were considered by the public to be physical and health
      threats. As a result of changes in the economic and social climate in the country, the practice of raising pets
      became accepted and popular, though the Society still has to deal daily with the phenomena of abandonment,
      neglect, abuse and distress which animals of all kinds continue to suffer to this
